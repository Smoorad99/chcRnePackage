# chcRne

## Overview and Installation

The chcRne package was developed to organize functions, useful code snippets, and other information relevant to the Research and Evaluation team at the Center for Healthy Communities.

```
# Run the following two lines of code to install chcRne
install.packages("devtools") 
devtools::install_github("Smoorad99/chcRnePackage")
```

## Examples
The following sections serve as a walk through to help users see how the chcRne functions can be used when cleaning data, making figures and tables, and reporting on those figures and tables.

### Data Management

Functions in this section are used for data management.

- We are using `yesno_to_binary` to change q14_1 - q14_10 from yes/no to 1/0.
```{r include=TRUE}
library(chcRne)
library(dplyr)

data <- bns2_pkg_data %>% select(q13, q14_1:q14_10)

df_converted <- yesno_to_binary(data, "q14_")
# View the converted dataframe side-by-side
old <- bns2_pkg_data |> dplyr::select(q14_1, q14_4)
new <- df_converted |> dplyr::select(q14_1, q14_4)
cbind(old, new) %>% head(10)

```

```{r echo=FALSE}
df_converted$q14_30 <- bns2_pkg_data$q14_30
```

- Each column of our mark all that apply question is now 1/0, which allows us to use `pnta.unanswered.to.miss()` to set all columns in the select all that apply question to NA when the "Prefer not to answer" option was selected.
```{r}
df_unanswered_to_miss <- pnta.unanswered.to.miss(data = df_converted,
                                  prefix = "q14_",
                                  pnta = bns2_pkg_data$q14_30)
new <- df_unanswered_to_miss %>%  select(q14_3:q14_5, q14_30)
new$q14_30 <- df_converted$q14_30
new %>% head(10)
```

<br/>

### Tables
Functions in this section are for the creation tables the R&E team frequently uses. 

- Now that our select all that apply question is clean, we can use a `nperc_tbl_MATA()` to create a table illustrating creates a table showing the n counts and percentages for each option in a mark all that apply question.
```{r table1, include=TRUE}
cols <- c("q14_3", "q14_4", "q14_5")
rnames <- c("I like cooking", "I am a broke college student", "I live with chefs")

# Create table that reports n count and percent for a mark all that apply question
mark_all_that_apply_tbl <- nperc_tbl_MATA(df = df_unanswered_to_miss,
               vars = cols,
               value = "1",
               row.names = rnames,
               punc = ".")
mark_all_that_apply_tbl
```

- If we were working with a single categorical variable we could use `question_table` to create a table with counts and percentages.

```{r}
# kbl_styling = FALSE indicating that we do not want any styling for the table
question_tbl <- question_table(data = bns2_pkg_data, 
                               x = 'q13', 
                               cnames = c("Level of Education", "Yes %"), 
                               kbl_styling = FALSE)

question_tbl
```

### Statistics (often used in inline code)
Functions in this section return statistics often used for figure/table summaries. Many of these functions will often be used in inline code.

- `print_n_reporting()` reports the count and percent of non-NA responses.

```{r}
print_n_reporting(bns2_pkg_data, "q13")
```


`count_and_percent()` returns a string that includes the total count and percentage of the categories in the input variable.

```{r}
# Getting the count and percent of respondents reporting some college or a bachelors degree.
count_and_percent(bns2_pkg_data$q13, "Some college", "Bachelor's degree")
```
